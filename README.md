# eZ-layout
A simple tool to allow developers to see how their layout behaves in a second :)

This tool allows you to see how the alignment and/or the superposition work(s).

It is more a learning tool than a professional one. It was built in a few minutes to help UX/UI students "feel" their code during a html/css intro course.

How it works
-------
Either add the following in the header of your index.html  
    
    <header>
    ...
        <script 
            type="text/javascript" 
            src="https://www.gramsco.dev/scripts/eZlayout.js" 
            async 
            >
        </script>
    </header>

Or copy the content of the file to access it locally:

    <script type="module" src="./myscripts/eZlayout.js">

What should appear
-----

![buttons]

that allows you to do that :

![borders]

and that : 
![background]


Enjoy,
